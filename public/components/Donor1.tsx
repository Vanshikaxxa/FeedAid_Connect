            The quality, wholesome prepared food donated from restaurants is a
            welcomed addition in the total effort to eliminate hunger in the
            United States â€“ The food is deeply appreciated by the food rescue
            programs committed to serving those who experience hunger. Our Donor
            Partners understand that, when prepared food is involved, a small
            amount at a time can rapidly build up to make a big difference.
